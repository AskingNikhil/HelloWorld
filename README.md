# HelloWorld
My first project for learning GitHub.

This is going great.
I am loving Git.

I am Nikhil Agarwal and am learning to Git.

Day 2:
A course on Git helps to sort few things.

Day 3:
Github and open source computing is really effective.. I will soon be starting to work on a live project on GitHub.
